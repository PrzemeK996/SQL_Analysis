# SQL_Analysis

Before I started learning the BI tool, I spent time learning SQL Server, which absorbed me a lot. I decided to do a short analysis using this program to document my knowledge.

# GDP, Population and Happiness analysis

I decided to analyze using 3 tables showing GDP over the years, the country's population over the years, and a 2020-based analysis of the satisfaction of the country's population. I was able to combine the tables by country names and was able to draw some interesting conclusions. I tried to use different skills of combining the tables, calculating the results to show my knowledge of SQL as well as possible.
In addition to the code itself, I also put the tables in the folder in a csv file and a database ready to be imported in SQL Server.
The databases were downloaded from kaggle.com
